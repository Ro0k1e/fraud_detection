# Fraud Detection Porject
The project aims to build an unsupervised tax fraud detection model with the dataset, Property Valuation and Assessment Data, which is retrieved from NYC open data platform, and find people misrepresenting their property characteristics and underpaying tax. For the project, data cleaning and imputation are conducted. Then, we think about the project goal to build variables that can better estimate a propertyâ€™s value and suggest abnormal properties. 93 new variables are created in this process based on the original field, and the less relevant fields are dropped. Given the large number of features in the dataset, PCA is implemented to reduce dimensionality and 5 main PCs are kept. After the dimensionality reduction, to find the anomality in the dataset, two scoring methods are implemented. Two additional columns are created to store the rank of each record in the dataset when the dataset is sorted in a descending order according to the two scores respectively. Then, the final fraud score is computed and the records with a high fraud score are considered as properties with high probability of having a fraud, which should be passed to experts for analysis and feedback so that the model can be further improved.
